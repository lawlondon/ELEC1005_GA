Jira Reports (Burnup chart and Burndown chart)
 
Description:
This project requires further information from part one. To complete this report, a few sections are included. For example, verification and validation, user manual, Jira reports, GitHub records and outcomes tested in PowerApps.
 
Jira Reports includes both burnup and burndown charts achieved from Jira. As team has done most of the work while working on part one of this assignment, so less time is required to complete part two. Therefore, the team has only spent less than a week to complete this report. However, the user interface and function implementation parts which are needed during project demonstration are still ongoing to achieve the best results.
